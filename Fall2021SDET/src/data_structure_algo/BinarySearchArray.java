     * 2. now we can split an array in half (n/2 )and compare our targetNum with last number in a split array
     * 3. if our targetNum is bigger than that we can continue search in other part of split array
     * 4. if our targetNum is smaller than that we can  ignore half of the elements just after one comparison
     * 5. and split an array again and do the same procedure until we find our targetNum
